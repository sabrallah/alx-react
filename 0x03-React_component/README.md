# Project: 0x03. React Component | ALX Africa Intranet

## Overview
This project is part of the ALX Africa Intranet curriculum, focusing on React component development. Led by Johann Kerbrat, Engineering Manager at Uber Works, the project delves into essential aspects of front-end development, emphasizing JavaScript, ES6, and React.

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** February 5, 2024, 7:00 PM
- **End Date:** February 8, 2024, 7:00 PM
- **Checker Release:** February 6, 2024, 1:00 PM
- **Manual QA Review:** Conducted by HAJAR EL ABDELLAOUI on February 6, 2024, 11:21 PM
- **Auto Review:** Scheduled for the deadline

## Learning Objectives
By the completion of this project, participants are expected to master the following concepts without relying on external resources:
1. Choosing between Class or Function to create a component
2. Understanding the lifecycle of a Class component
3. Testing components effectively, including using Jest spy for function calls
4. Implementing and comprehending Higher Order Components (HOC)
5. Performance optimization and controlling component rendering

## Requirements
- Operating Environment: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Node Version: 12.x.x
- npm Version: 6.x.x
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files must end with a new line
- Mandatory README.md file at the project root

## Tasks Overview
1. **Commence with class components:**
   - Convert the App function into a React Class
   - Ensure existing tests pass without errors

2. **Lifecycles:**
   - Add a lifecycle event to the App Class
   - Create tests to verify proper functioning, including handling key events

3. **Handling Events:**
   - Convert Notifications function into a React Class
   - Add new functionality for marking notifications as read
   - Implement tests for new functionality

4. **Reusable Components & Specialization:**
   - Create new components, BodySection and BodySectionWithMarginBottom
   - Ensure correct rendering and styling
   - Integrate new components into the App and write corresponding tests

5. **Use the New Components:**
   - Update App component to use newly created components
   - Ensure correct rendering and styling
   - Write tests to validate the changes

6. **Test the New Components:**
   - Write tests for the newly created components
   - Verify correct rendering and functionality

7. **Create WithLogging HOC:**
   - Implement a Higher Order Component (HOC) for logging mount and unmount events
   - Update the displayName for debugging purposes

8. **Write a Test for the HOC:**
   - Write tests to ensure proper logging for mount and unmount events
   - Validate functionality with different wrapped elements

9. **Declare a Pure Component:**
   - Modify NotificationItem to be a "pure" component
   - Ensure it updates only when props and state change

10. **Make Your Own Pure Component:**
    - Modify Notifications to update only when the listNotifications property has a longer list
    - Implement shouldComponentUpdate for performance optimization

11. **Add a Test:**
    - Write tests to verify that the Notifications component behaves correctly when updating props

## Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of React components, covering key concepts and practical implementations. Participants will gain hands-on experience in component development, testing, and performance optimization. The project's structure encourages a deeper understanding of React and prepares participants for real-world front-end development challenges.
