## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, participants are expected to:
- Understand the state of a React component or container
- Grasp the lifecycle of a React component
- Learn to modify state and execute code in the correct order
- Work with controlled components and forms in React
- Reuse smaller components, keeping them pure, and lifting their state to principal containers
- Utilize React Hooks and create one
- Test state changes with Enzyme
