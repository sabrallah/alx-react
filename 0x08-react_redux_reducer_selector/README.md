  - Immutable Map & Documentation
  - Intro to Normalizr
  - Strategy for Normalizing State Shape

## Learning Outcomes

Upon wrapping up this sprint, you'll be adept at articulating:

- Reducers' purposes and their critical role in apps
- The necessity of reducers remaining pure
- Avoiding mutations within reducers
- Implementing Immutable in reducers
- Applying Normalizr in apps
- The essence of Selectors and their application timing

## Project Requirements

- **Permitted Editors**: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- **Syntax Compliance**: Files should conclude with a newline
- **Tech Stack**: Node 12.x.x and npm 6.x.x on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Documentation**: A README.md at the root is a non-negotiable

## Deliverables

Tasks focus on shaping a robust understanding and functional competence:

- **Task 0**: Craft a barebones reducer to drive the UI
  - Define the initial state requirements within `reducers/uiReducer.js`
  - Concoct a reducer function adept at responding to UI action types and execute tests to ensure efficacy.
- **Task 1**: Enhance the UI Reducer using Immutable.js
  - Integrate Immutable.js and re-engineer `uiReducer.js`
  - Update the tests to cover Immutable.js integrations
- **Task 2**: Put together a Courses reducer
  - Introduce a load action for course retrieval
  - Script the course reducer, instantiate the default state, and conduct tests for assured performance
- **Task 3**: Frame the reducer for notifications
  - Orchestrate a load action for fetching notifications
  - Compose the notification reducer and default state, and then methodically test for dependability
- **Task 4**: Refine with Normalizr & Immutable
  - Employ Normalizr to simplify mutations and update the schema accordingly
  - Revisit reducers and test files, fortifying them with Normalizr and Immutable.js
- **Task 5**: Deploy selectors for enhanced state access
  - Craft selectors for the Notifications reducer and validate them with a dedicated test suite
