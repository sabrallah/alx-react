## 0x06. React Immutable - README.md

**Project: Explore immutability in JavaScript with Immutable.js**

This project delves into the concept of immutability in JavaScript using the Immutable.js library. You'll gain hands-on experience creating immutable objects, accessing nested elements, and manipulating data without altering the original structure.

### Project Details

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you'll be able to:

* **Grasp the concept of immutability and its benefits:** Understand how immutability helps you write cleaner, more predictable, and easier-to-test code.
* **Leverage Immutable.js:** Master essential techniques for creating and managing immutable data structures using the Immutable.js library.
* **Differentiate between List and Map:** Learn the distinct purposes and usage patterns of Immutable.js List and Map data structures.
* **Employ Merge, Concat, and Deep Merging:** Confidently apply these functions to effectively combine and manipulate immutable data.
* **Work with lazy sequences (Seq):** Utilize the Seq API to optimize performance and memory usage when dealing with large datasets.

### Requirements

* **Allowed Text Editors:** vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
* **Mandatory README.md:** Include a README.md file in your project's root directory.
* **Platform:** Code will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Node.js 12.x.x and npm 6.x.x.
* **Newlines and Exports:** Ensure all files end with a newline and all functions are exported.

### Setup

Follow the instructions provided in the project description to install Node.js and npm.

### Provided Files

* `babel.config.js`
* `jsconfig.json`
* `package.json`

### Tasks

This project consists of eight mandatory tasks:

1. **Converting to an Immutable Object using fromJS**
2. **Converting into Immutable using Map**
3. **Accessing Nested Elements**
4. **List and Push**
5. **Merge & Concat**
6. **Nested Merge**
7. **Equality**
